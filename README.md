In this project, will be developing a guessing random number game.
This project will use React and Solidity for the game to be used in web3.0
React will be use for frontend, Solidity will be used for backend and deploy the contract to the blockchain
User will need to download metamask and register an account for it to work.

a env file will be need to create
INFURA_API_KEY = insert ur infura key
GEORLI_PRIVATE_KEY = insert ur georli key

the env file is used to deploy the contract based on your infura and georli key.

Execute the file:
in terminal
1. npm i --force// to install all the dependency
2. cd src // go to src
3. npm start // to start react file


changing account in meta mask will auto change in the web also.
only the owner can show the target number
careful the amount of ether u bet.
